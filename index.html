            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div class="about-main">
              <p>Born and raised in Upstate New York, I now live in West Fork, AR, with my lovely fianc√©e, our two cats, a tiny chihuahua, a bearded dragon, and a flock of chickens. I'm an aspiring software developer, looking for opportunities to make an impact here in Northwest Arkansas. I focus mostly on web technologies, but I have a strong passion for anything programming-related I can get my hands on.</p>
            </div>
            <a class="read-story active">Read my story</a>
            <div class="extra-story">
              <div class="cover"></div>
              <p>I live in Northwest Arkansas now, but before I ended up here, I spent most of the last decade travelling around and living in various strange places. From working in a dog daycare in Manhattan to picking wild mushrooms in the mountains of New Mexico, backpacking through remote villages in India, or hitchhiking through Wyoming, I was always on the move.</p>
              <p>In those years of being a <span>hopeless vagabond</span> spirited adventurer, aided by a relentless curiosty and the romantic idealism of a naive youth, I tried as hard as I could to learn everything a young man could learn. Along the way, I picked up a wide variety of trades and skills, but nothing ever seemed to satisfy me. I was well on my way to being the proverbial jack of all trades (and master of none), until I one day found myself staring at my laptop, scratching my head: </p>
              <p>"Huh, you know, now that I think about it, I don't really even know how this thing works..."</p>
              <p>This was unacceptable to me. A glaring oversight that needed immediate attention. Before I knew it, I was in deep, and I was hooked.</p>
              <p>Starting with semiconductors and logic gates, I finally learned what all those 1s and 0s are that I've heard so much about. I moved on to memory and ALU instructions, the K&R C book, TCP/IP, OOP, web technologies, and so on, and quickly became obsessed; I couldn't get enough. For every question that I sought an answer to, countless new questions arose, each one unfolding into vast new worlds of knowledge. What started as just another conquest in my endless campaign of being a know-it-all quickly became a life-defining passion.</p>
              <p>And just like that, my travel itch subsided. I didn't need to keep wandering around looking for new things to learn. I found the holy grail. There are more things to learn in the world of computers, programming, and technology than someone could fit into a lifetime, with each new year bringing even more. The quest will never end, the finish line will never be reached, and I wouldn't want it any other way.</p>
              <p>So here's my little site. This is my attempt to put myself out there, to try to turn this passion into something more. Put simply, I'm trying to start my dream career; to find somewhere to get my foot in the door, where I can be a part of something bigger, and put my knowledge, skills, and passion into something productive.</p>
              <p>Below you'll find a few little projects that I've made recently, showcasing a variety of different tech, hopefully illustrating my versatility and willingness to learn new things.</p>
              <p>Thanks for visiting; feel free to reach out and say hello.</p>

        <h4>Here's how it works:</h4>
        <p>Your inventory consists of items, called 'stocks'. Once you have items in stock,
          there's a few things you can do:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Place an order for more</li>
            <li>Update an order status</li>
            <li>Sell some of the stock</li>
            <li>Set up an alert</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Updating an order status to 'Completed' will automatically update
            the quantity that you have in stock. Same goes for selling an item.
          </p>
          <p>There are two types of alerts -- low stock, and out-of-stock.
            When an alert gets triggered, you'll be able to see it on the dashboard. Clicking the
            checkbox next to the alert notification will dismiss the alert. Any change to the item quantity 
            (whether via an order or sale), will re-trigger any relevant alerts. Alerts can be turned on and 
            off on the Alert page.
          </p>

        <h4>Here's how it works:</h4>
        <p>The main pieces of data are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Customers</li>
          <li>Estimates</li>
          <li>Jobs</li>
          <li>Invoices</li>
          <li>Tasks</li>
          <li>Notes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Before you can do anything, you need a customer. Once you have a customer, you can 
          create new estimates, jobs or invoices for them.
        </p>
        <p>Any estimate or job consists of contact information for the customer, 
          a description of the job, and a list 
          of tasks. Because tasks are treated as their own distinct models in the data, it's quite simple 
          to turn an estimate into a job, and a job into an invoice. For example, when creating a job, you have 
          the option of selecting from any estimates already associated with that customer (same goes for invoice/jobs).
        </p>
        <p>However, changing a task in a job won't change it in the estimate (same for invoices).</p>
        <p>The intended workflow is: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You get a new lead, a new customer calls your shop or finds you at a jobsite. (Create customer)</li>
          <li>That new customer is looking for a quote on getting some work done. (Create estimate)</li>
          <li>The customer approves the quote, or makes some changes, and is ready to move forward (Create job)</li>
          <li>The job is complete, and you're ready to send an invoice to the customer (Create invoice)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Feel free to create your own user, but please don't use any credentials that you use for 
          something else. The default login is:
